# CO2-Visuzlization

- Data: Our data is sourced from the United States Energy Information Administration and is compiled to facilitate easier analysis. It encompasses several major factors influencing CO2 emissions, ranging from the production and consumption of each type of primary energy source for each country to the pollution ranking of that country each year. It also includes the GDP of each country, population, energy intensity per capita, and energy intensity per GDP. All the data spans from the years 1980 to 2020.
- In this project, we analyze the data by visulizing on Tableau also by comparing the prediction of 3 difference models.
